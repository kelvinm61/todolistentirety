Hi and thank you for downloading my To-do list App. I created this app to be simple and fun to use. To use this App is very simple. To add a new to do just type in your new task where it shows you on the middle tab(add to list tab), then click the add to list button, the task has now been added to your To Do list. to view this and other tasks simply click the to do list icon at the bottom of the page. Once clicked the tab with all the to do's walloped and you can now view all of them that are there. A very useful and handy feature i have added to my app is the "forgotten something" tab. Click the "forgotten something" icon and a page will open up with a list of the most commonly forgotten items. Thats all there is to know about my app thats how easy it is to use, thanks again for downloading.
